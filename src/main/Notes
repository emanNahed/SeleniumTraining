- here put utilities, page classes, libraries, in test will create
only test cases.

-crm is your applications name, ask Mostafa about the name com.crm.qa.page
- report package will create automatically.


rules:
    - create class for each page

why pom?
    - If UI of the page change, we don't need to change the test, Just the code in specific page class.
    - Sigle repository for the services or operations offered by the page.
    -all test cases are independent from each others.
